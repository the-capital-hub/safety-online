      <p>
        We accept returns only for damaged, defective, short-shipped, or
        incorrectly supplied items. Change-of-mind returns are not available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Report transit damage/shortage within 48 hours of delivery and
        wrong/defective items within 7 days: support@ladwapartner.com (include
        Order ID and photos/videos of the box, label, packing, and product). An
        RMA approval is required before sending anything back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-returnable: custom/made-to-order items (e.g., printed signages),
        opened PPE, used/installed goods, items missing accessories/labels, and
        clearance sale items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returned items must be unused, in original packaging with all
        accessories/manuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolution: replacement is preferred (subject to stock); if unavailable,
        we will refund or issue store credit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refunds are initiated after QC of the returned item (typically 2–4
        business days from receipt); banks/gateways may take 3–7 business days
        to credit.
      </p>
      <p>
        For approved cases, we may arrange reverse pickup; if self-shipping is
        requested, use a trackable service as instructed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cancellations before dispatch are fully refundable; after dispatch, they
        are treated as returns.
      </p>
